# This workflow handles both nightly builds and version releases:
# - Runs automatically at midnight UTC every day to create nightly releases
# - Runs when a tag starting with 'v' is pushed to create version releases
# - Can be manually triggered via workflow_dispatch
# - Builds for Linux (deb/rpm), Windows (msi), and Android (apk)
